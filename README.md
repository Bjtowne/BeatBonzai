A "guitarhero" like game programmed in intyBasic for the classic console the Intellivision.

You can test the program by downloading the ROM and playing it on any Intellevision emulator. You can find general instructions on how to use IntyBasic on the following web address.

The program is currently glitched whereas it will get slower and slower the longer you play it until it freezes.
